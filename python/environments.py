    - Docker for python projects
    - All the required libraries and python version in that environment
    - Create activate cd deactive

    1. Make environment     (python3 -m venv envname)
    2. Start                (source env/bin/activate)
    3. Install requirements (pip install and pip freeze > requirements.txt)
    4. Once done, delete venv to avoid bloat (rm -rf venv)
